A short SIPTAPI installation tutorial .....

(Note: For better debugging the binaries are usually built 
in "Debug" mode, and thus write a log file to c:\siptapi_0.2.log)

Use "SingleLine" for a SIPTAPI with a single line, use "MultiLine" to get 40 lines.

On 32bit Windows
=================
1. Copy siptapi_0.3.tsp from 32bit folder into your Windows system32 directory 
   (usually C:\Windows\System32)
2. Install and configure SIPTAPI using the telephony options from control panel

On 64bit Windows
=================
1. Copy siptapi_0.3.tsp from 64bit folder into your Windows system32 directory 
   (usually C:\Windows\System32). This gives you full TAPI support with 64 and 32bit
   TAPI applications

   Note: You MUST copy the siptapi_0.3.tsp file with a 64bit application. If you use a 32bit
   application, Windows will transparently map the system32 folder to SysWOW64 (32bit 
   compatibility for 64bit Windows). Therefore, the following method is preferred:
   1. Unzip the siptapi_0.3.tsp file on your Desktop
   2. Use Windows-Explorer to move the siptapi_0.3.tsp file from your Desktop to c:\Windows\system32

2. Install and configure SIPTAPI using the telephony options from control panel

Note: On Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7, Server 2008 you MUST configure SIPTAPI via 
the Windows Control Panel (Systemsteuerung) and you need Administrator privileges to 
do this. Some TAPI applications allow you also configuration via their dial dialog but 
this will not work and can be ignored.
