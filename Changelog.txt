Version 0.3.23
==============
- Set Address to the SIPTAPI line number in TSPI_lineGetAddressCaps
- Do not log string-parameters when entering TSPI_ functions as there is a Unicode/ANSI/MultiByteChar
  confusion which may crash during conversion. Now, Debug versions should work fine again.

Version 0.3.22
==============
- Add CalledID Info from To header

Version 0.3.21
==============
- call eXosip_event_wait() without lock, as this holds the lock almost always.
  Due to that, the Release build was slow as it almost never obtained the lock.
- Check eXosip context before allocateing memory to avoid multiple allocations

Version 0.3.20
==============
- As build time option an "DOMAINSUFFIX" can be added. This forces the SIP domain and
  the outbound proxy to end with "DOMAINSUFFIX". If the domain already contains the
  suffix, the DOMAINSUFFIX will not be appended.
- Set Version Text in Config Dialog dynamically
- GUI: "Line X" instead of "Settings Line X", to have more space once I reformat the GUI

Version 0.3.19
==============
- Add a backup-logic to identify the correct TAPI line for incoming INVITE requests without
  line=... parameter in the request-URI (If the SIP server does buggy NAT traversal, the line=
  parameter may not show up in incoming R-RURI). Now, also the username in the incoming RURI is
  checked. Note: This may select the wrong TAPI line if multiple TAPI lines use the same username.

- use string::c_str() instead of string::data()

Version 0.3.18
==============
- update osip/eXosip to version 4.1 to fix problems with registration intervalls < 100 seconds.
  eXosip now allows expire values > 30 seconds
- align SIPTAPI to the new API of eXosIP 4

Version 0.3.17
==============
- add "SIPTAPI_0.3" to logging

Version 0.3.16
==============
- Fix incoming call indication in Windows 8 64bit. Change parameters of
  callback function from DWORD to DWORD_PTR as suggested in this thread:
  http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsdesktop/en-US/1d9646d9-ea18-4bfa-8214-d017cab97d56/windows-8-tapi-issues?forum=windowsgeneraldevelopmentissues
  and
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms725228%28v=vs.85%29.aspx


Version 0.3.15
==============
- If during TapiLine->shutdown() the shutdown_nowait() fails (due to fail of 
  eXosip_call_terminate(ctx, )), report asynch completion.
- Fixed disabling of reverse-mode/ACD-mode


Version 0.3.14
==============
- Inverse the "disable realm" feature. It is now called
  "enable realm check for authentication". Default (not checked) means that the realm
  in the authentication header need not match the user's SIP domain. This is more "plug and play"
  as many SIP-PBX/Server use a realm which is different to the SIP domain.
- New feature "Send 180 Ringing". When activated, SIPTAPI will respond to incoming 
  INVITEs (incoming call indication) with 180 Ringing. This is a workaround for SIP-Server
  which gets confused by SIPTAPI only sending "101".
- Change the prototype of the call-back function on incoming calls from DWORD to DWORD_PTR.
  This fixes the incoming call issue with Windows 8. For details see:
  http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsdesktop/en-US/1d9646d9-ea18-4bfa-8214-d017cab97d56/windows-8-tapi-issues
- Add "reverse-mode" feature. (ACD-mode and reverse-mode are mutual exclusive)
  - Normal mode: The local phone gets called, and on ANSWER, the phone gets 
    refered to the actual target
  - Reverse mode: The actual target gets called, and on ANSWER, the target 
    gets refered to the local phone
  - ACD mode: The actual target gets called, and on ANSWER nothing happens. The 
    TAPI application must initiate a blind transfer to transfer the call to a local phone extension.

Version 0.3.13
==============
- Allow configuration of more than 40 lines by direct configuration in the 
  Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Telephony\SIPTAPI
  See file "SIPTAPI Line Configuration via Registry.txt" for details

Version 0.3.12
==============
- proper NOTIFY handling (check sipfrag)
- signal line-state events only once per state
- SIP over TCP support

Version 0.3.11
==============
- updated osip/eXosip to 3.5.0
- added auto-answer: add header to indicate to phone that it should answer the call
  SNOM: http://asterisk.snom.com/index.php/Asterisk_1.4/Intercom
    Call-Info: <sip:127.0.0.1>;answer-after=0");
  Polycom: http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Polycom+auto-answer+config
    Alert-Info: Ring Answer

Version 0.3.10
==============
- allow to specify the phone's extension with domain (e.g. use name@127.0.0.1 to workaround a bug in Xlite/Bria)
- enabled code for Reason header support (requires eXosip/osip git newer than 2011-01-01)
- uses osip/eXosip from git from 2011-01-03

Version 0.3.9
=============
- code preparations for Reason header (show incoming calls as answered)
- update registry path to work around permission issues in Vista and Win7:
    Software\\IPCom\\SIPTAPI --> SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Telephony\\SIPTAPI
    Software\\IPCom\\SIPTAPI-ACD --> SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Telephony\\SIPTAPI-ACD

Version 0.3.8
=============
- extend to 40 lines
- try 300 UDP ports to open for SIP until fail
- report LINECALLFEATURE_DROP in TSPI_lineGetCallStatus, allow to cancel outgoing call with dialers which query the supported commands
- successfully tested incoming and outgoing calls with comtech's CRM/ERP system com(organize)
- added "ACD mode" for ACD dialers (e.g. Grutzeck's "overdialer"): calls first the to be dialed target and then manually requests a blindTransfer to an agent

Version 0.3.7
=============
- SIP User Agent header zeigt die SIPTAPI und eXosip Version an
- make SIPTAPI work with Lotus Organizer (backport from sourceforge siptapi)
- outboundproxy is always a loose router (automatically add ;lr parameter)
- change registry location of configuration storage. If you update SIPTAPI just
  rename HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\enum.at\SipTapi to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IPCom\SIPTAPI
- updated osip and eXosip to version 3.3.0
- fixed copyrights: replaced "enum.at" with "IPCom GmbH"
- commented unused code
- reworked SIPTAPI-Installer
- cleaned up doc\ directory

Version 0.3.6
=============
- bugfix in SIPTAPI: hangup geht nun schneller EXOSIP_CALL_RELEASE event dauert 15-30 Sekunden, nicht mehr darauf warten.

Version 0.3.5
=============
- bugfix: problems when TAPI reused htCall handles as we use this also as the hdCall handle and it was not set to 0 (TSPI_lineCloseCall)

Version 0.3.4
=============
- new option in GUI: disable realm check (in eXosip_add_authentication_info(ctx, ) set realm to 0 to allow realm differ from domain)

Version 0.3.3
=============
- bugfixing

Version 0.3.2
=============
- support for incoming call indication (calls can not be accepted via TAPI - only indication)
- changed adding authetnication info to eXosip to work with incoming call identification (REGISTER)

Version 0.3.1
=============
- fixed some bugs

Version 0.3.0
=============
- complete rewrite of the SIPTAPI
- new class design, only the TAPI interace is still used from asttapi
- multiline capable, thus SIPTAI can be used in terminal server environments too

Version 0.2.x
=============
- released on sourceforge.net
- removed Asterisk stuff from asttapi and added eXosip
